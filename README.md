### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt Talley and I've always been keenly interested in logic puzzles and problem-solving. 

As a kid, I loved completing the "Jane's favorite color is blue, and she's taller than Bill but shorter than Sarah"-type logic puzzles and practiced with a Rubik's Cube so much that I once solved it in **one minute and four seconds.** (to my ever-lasting shame, I never quite managed to break the 60 second barrier)

It's no surprise that I've been building and repairing computers since I was a teenager, but what I do find surprising is that it took me so long to get into the software side of things and learn to code! Better late than never, as they say. 

The first language I learned was Python; I completed a 72-hour course on Udemy titled [Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/) with Tim Buchalka. 

I used what I learned about Python to code some simple games like Hang-Man and Black-Jack, put together some client-data calculators for my business and I also solved the first 20 math-coding problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

I'm currently working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full-stack JavaScript course, having completed the Foundations course in December 2022. You can see some of the projects I've completed thus far in my repositories. Here are links to their live GitHub pages:

#### [Calculator](https://socrastein.github.io/calculator/)
#### [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://socrastein.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
#### [Book Library](https://socrastein.github.io/book-library/)
#### [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://socrastein.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)
#### [Pixel Art](https://socrastein.github.io/pixel-art/)

I'm also currently working through the Responsive Web Design course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). There's a lot of overlap with The Odin Project lessons, so I tend to go back and forth between them as it reinforces the concepts to see them presented in different ways.  

Whenever I get into a topic I tend to get **really** into it, so the rest of my self-learning road map is fairly ambitious: 

##### Free Code Camp
  - Responsive Web Design
  - JavasScript Data Structures & Algorithms

##### Udemy
  - React: The Complete Guide (49.5 hrs)
  - Testing React with Jest & RTL (8 hrs)
  - NodeJS: The Complete Guide (40.5 hrs)
  - SQL and PostgreSQL: The Complete Developer's Guide (22 hrs)
  - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass (22 hrs)

##### HarvardX
  - CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

I also have a number of highly-recommended books I've either read or am planning to read, such as 'Clean Code' by Robert Martin, 'Eloquent JavaScript' by Marijn Haverbeke and 'A Philosophy of Software Design' by John Ousterhout.

My most important personal and professional coding project is rebuilding my website with a front & back-end for managing my clients' data so I no longer have to pay for website building/hosting and can automate a great deal of tedious, repetitive work that my job requires. This will allow me to focus on the big picture with my training while also providing a better, more professional level of service to everyone I work with. 

Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about me and my journey. If you have any questions or comments about anything on my GitHub, please don't hesitate to contact me: matt (at) theliftingschool.com
