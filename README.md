### Hi there 👋

My name is Matt Talley. I've been self-learning how to code for the last few years, and am currently enrolled in the Computer Science program at The College of Western Idaho. 

I've always been keenly interested in logic puzzles and problem-solving, which led to an early interest in how computers work and what cool things can be done with them. I've been building and repairing my and others' personal computers since I was a teenager, and I even have some work experience in technology sales and repair. Now I'm learning to code and it's been a thrill to finally dive into the software side of these amazing machines. 

<br>

🌱 Python is the first language I started with. I completed a 72-hour course on Udemy titled [Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/) with Tim Buchalka. 

I used what I learned about Python to code some simple games like Hang-Man and Black-Jack, put together some client-data calculators for my business and I also solved the first 20 math-coding problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

I then worked through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full-stack JavaScript course. I think the way the Odin Project is put together, especially it's emphasis on incrementally more complex projects all along the way, is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning web development. You can see some of the projects from that course in my portfolio.
