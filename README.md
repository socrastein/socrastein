### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt Talley. I've always been keenly interested in logic puzzles and problem-solving, which led to an early interest in how computers work and what cool things can be done with them. I've been building and repairing my and others' personal computers since I was a teenager, and I have some work experience in technology sales and repair. Now I'm learning to code, starting with Python and JavaScript, and it's a real thrill to finally dive into the software side of computers.

<br>

ðŸŒ± Python is the language I started with. I completed a 72-hour course on Udemy titled [Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/) with Tim Buchalka. 

I used what I learned about Python to code some simple games like Hang-Man and Black-Jack, put together some client-data calculators for my business and I also solved the first 20 math-coding problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

<br>

I'm currently working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full-stack JavaScript course. You can see some of the projects in my repositories. Here are links to the live GitHub pages:

- #### [Lifting App](https://the-lifting-app.web.app/)
- #### [Weight Plate Counter](https://socrastein.github.io/weightPlateCounter/)
- #### [NSCA CPT Study Questions](https://socrastein.github.io/NSCAstudying/)
- #### [Battleship](https://socrastein.github.io/battleship/)
- #### [Weather App](https://socrastein.github.io/weather-app/)
- #### [Minesweeper](https://socrastein.github.io/minesweeper/)
- #### [Calculator](https://socrastein.github.io/calculator/)
- #### [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://socrastein.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
- #### [Book Library](https://socrastein.github.io/book-library/)
- #### [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://socrastein.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)
- #### [Pixel Art](https://socrastein.github.io/pixel-art/)

<br>

I'm also currently working through the Responsive Web Design course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). There's a lot of overlap with The Odin Project lessons, so I tend to go back and forth between them as it reinforces the concepts to see them presented in different ways.  

<br>

This is a rough outline of the rest of my roadmap for study:

  - [NodeJS: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) (40.5 hrs)
  - [SQL and PostgreSQL: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql/) (22 hrs)
